%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%
\abstract{The introduction of physical simulation to visual effects
applications has given rise to new challenges.  In contrast to most
engineering and computational physics applications, lower order models are
typically preferred with an emphasis on fast, visually compelling
effects over more accurate results. To this
end, artist-tunable material parameters as well as fast turnaround
times are needed, further emphasizing a need for efficient
algorithms. We present a number of simulation
techniques and numerical solvers targeted to visual effects. In
particular, we
introduce a parallel
multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm for Poisson's
equation on voxelized domains and demonstrate applications to the simulation of
incompressible flows including smoke and free surface fluids; we
present a hair collision algorithm which utilizes incompressible flow
techniques to precondition geometric hair collisions, allowing an
unprecedented number of hairs to be simulated; and finally, we introduce a new parallel multigrid
solver for corotational linear elasticity on voxelized domains and apply the solver to the problem of skeleton-driven,
collision-aware character skinning.}
